K-MEANS CLUSTERING FOR OUTLIER DETECTION

We'll use k-means to do outlier detection on a cluster of points.

We're potentially removing points that were generated by the data-generating process by removing outliers. On the other hand, outliers can be due to a measurement error or some other outside factor. 

The act of outlier detection is a matter of finding the centroids of the clusters and then identifying points that are potential outliers by their distances from the centroid.

Tools to use for this tutorial
- Pycharm IDE/ Spyder/ VSCode
- Python 3.6/3.7
- SciKit-Learn
-  Numpy & Matplotlib
- Make_Blobs Dataset (Scikit-Learn)

Note: There are three scatter plots in this lesson
1) Discovers the centroid among all data points.
2) Discovers points farthest away.
3) Differentiates old and new centroids.
